# NoteKeeper Sample Project

This app keeps notes on pluralsight courses.
The app performs the following fundamental tasks

- displays a list of notes
- edits existing notes
- creates new notes

A single note has 3 basic parts

1. The name of the course which must correspond to a pluralsight course
2. The title of the note as defined by the user
3. The contents of the note - long text entered by the user
